# Data-Structures-Project

 Simulation of a Linux Scheduler using Priority Queues
 
Description:
You are in possession of a program that's been parallelized and employs ùëõ individual threads to tackle a given list of m jobs or tasks. 
Threads operate on these tasks in the sequence they appear in the input. Whenever a thread becomes available, it promptly picks up the next job from the list. 
Once a thread commences processing a job, it proceeds without interruption until the job reaches completion. 
In cases where multiple threads vie for tasks from the list at the same time, the thread with the lower index takes precedence. 
Each job comes with a precise processing time, which remains constant across all threads. 
Your task involves determining both which threads will be responsible for processing each job and when that processing will commence.
